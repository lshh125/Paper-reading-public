# A large peptidome dataset improves HLA class I epitope prediction across most of the human population

## Terminology and nomeclature
- HLA: human leukocyte antigen; 
  - a gene that encodes MHC (major histocompatibility complex)
  - glycoprotein; expressed in almost all cells
  - chr6p21

- Highly polygenic (many genes)
  - Class I (A, B, C; most somatic cells; 8-11 AA; CD8), II (DR, DQ, DP; antigen presenting cell; 10-30; CD4) and III
- Highly polymorphic (contains multiple variations of antigens or alleles)
  - HLA B\*27:05 vs B\*27:08 are distinct.
- Pleiotropic (has many functions)
  - self vs nonself
  - antigen presentation
