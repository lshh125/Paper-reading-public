# NetMHCpan-4.0: Improved Peptideâ€“MHC Class I Interaction Predictions Integrating Eluted Ligand and Peptide Binding Affinity Data

Background:
- Cytotoxic T cells scrutinizing the surface of cells for the non-self peptides presented in complex with MHC molecules
- 
- Binding to MHC is the most selective step in the pathway leading to this peptide presentation.
