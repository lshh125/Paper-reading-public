# Benchmarking single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols for cell atlas projects
Elisabetta Mereu et al.

- RNA capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs
- relative advantages for different applications

Protocol differences:
- library complexity
- ability to detect cell-type markers
- predictive value (power to describe cell types/states)
