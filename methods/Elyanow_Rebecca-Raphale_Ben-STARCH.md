# TARCH: Copy number and clone inference from spatial transcriptomics data
Rebecca Elyanow, Ron Zeira, Max Land, and Benjamin J. Raphael

Assumptions:
1. Small number of tumor clones, each with a distinct CNP
2. CNAs span several genes
3. cells in a spot belong to the same clone
4. nearby spots contain cells from the same clone
