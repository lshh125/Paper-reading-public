# SpatialDWLS: accurate deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic data

Rui Dong, Guo-Cheng Yuan



Estimate cell-type composition at each spatial location



Technologies that don't have single-cell resolution: ST, 10X Visium, Slide-seq, DBiT-seq, Nanostring GeoMx



2 Steps:

1. identifies cell types that are likely to be present at each location
2. infer composition by DWLS
